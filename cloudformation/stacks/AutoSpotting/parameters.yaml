# Note: this is just an example on how the stack can be executed in a test
# setting, you may want to change it for your production use case.

# This file is handled automatically using the clouds-aws tool. It can be
# installed using pip, or from https://github.com/elias5000/clouds-aws. The same

# This only needs to be changed if you update from an old build that was using
# the Python shim for Go before AWS released official Go support for Lambda.
# Because Lambda caches the code based on the path, you likely also need to
# update the LambdaZipPath to explicitly pick up a more recent build.
